h1. How it works - Just press F11!  

The Slide Show (S9) Ruby gem turns your slides in plain text into a web page 
that's an all-in-one-page handout and a live slide show all at once.

{{{
$ slideshow tutorial

=> Preparing slide show 'tutorial.html'...
=> Done.
}}}


Turn your web page into a slide show and your browser into full screen projection
with a single push button (F11).  Hit the space bar or the right arrow, down arrow
  or page down key to flip through your slides.
 
That's all. It's that simple.


h1. What's Opera Show? What's FullerScreen?

h3. Opera Show

Opera has been shipping with built-in full screen projection and slide show support for years (since Opera 4)! 
Pioneered the concept using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS2) that offer/include 
the @projection@ media type in addition to @screen@, @print@ or @handheld@, for example.

h3. FullerScreen

A free, open source Firefox addon that lets you turn your web page into a 
slide show and your browser into full screen projection with a single push button (F11).

FullerScreen - More than just full screen projection:

* Built-in slide manager with thumbnails!
* Use spacebar, arrows, page up/down keys to move between slides/steps
* Use top and end keys to move to first/last slide
* Move mouse to the bottom-right screen corner to show joystick


h1. What's S5? What's S6?

h3. Simple Standards-based Slide Show System (S5)

Eric Meyer's (of CSS fame) public domain (free, open source) slide show package 
inspired by Opera Show and others that works in all modern browsers (without any plugin required
  because it includes its own slide show machinery in JavaScript).


h3. S6 - Easier to Understand and Extend S5 Rewrite 

S6 is the rewrite of Eric Meyer's S5 using the jQuery JavaScript library -- offering easier to
understand and easier to extend code. Add plugins, effects and more. Contributions welcome!

h3. Keyboard Controls

| Action | Key |
| Go to next slide | Space Bar, Right Arrow, Down Arrow, Page Down |
| Go to previous slide | Left Arrow, Up Arrow, Page Up |
| Go to first slide | Home |
| Go to last slide | End |
| Toggle between slideshow and outline view (&#216;) | T |
| Show/hide slide controls (&#216; &laquo; &raquo;) | C, Move mouse to bottom right corner |



h1. Gradient Themes Using "Loss-Free" Vector Graphics in S9 

Firefox and Opera (and Safari too) ship with built-in machinery for
 theming slide shows using "loss-free" vector  graphics. Offers "Flash/Silverlight-like" functionality out-of-the-box (no plugin download/installation required) using free web standards -
 a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation known as - surprise, surprise 
 - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).


Creating a gradient theme is as easy as:

{{{
<linearGradient id="top_bottom" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">
  <stop offset="0%"   style="stop-color: red" />
  <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color: black" />
</linearGradient>
}}}

Note, S9 ships with nine predefined 
  gradient styles such as "Diagonal", "Radial Off Center", "Radial Repeat", "Top Bottom"
 and S9 lets you define your gradient themes in plain text. Example:

{{{
gradient: top-bottom red black
}}}

or:

{{{
gradient-colors: #0e1f5b #3b5998
}}}


h1. Turn Your Online Wiki Pages into Slide Shows - Sputnik Case Study

Inspired by the Slide Show (S9) Ruby gem - Yuri Takhteyev has added S9-style slide shows
  to "Sputnik":http://sputnik.freewisdom.org/en/Slideshow_Demo - a wiki in Lua.

Lets you author slide shows online in your browser.
It's - surprise, surpise - a wiki and, thus, lets you
 work togther with others on a slide show, 
track changes and versions, link and get linked, and much much more.
