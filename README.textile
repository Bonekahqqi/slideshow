h2. What's Slide Show (S9)?

A Ruby gem that lets you create slide shows and author slides in plain text using
a wiki-style markup language that's easy-to-write and easy-to-read.
The Slide Show (S9) project also collects and welcomes themes
and ships "out-of-the-gem" with built-in support
for "loss-free" gradient vector graphics themes. More "Slide Show ==(S9)== Project Site &raquo;":http://slideshow.rubyforge.org
